## Clearco Origin & Company Overview

*Clearco is a modern non-dillutive capital as a service (CaaS) firm. The FinTech comapny was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.*



**President & Co-founder**: Michele Romanow (left)
**CEO & Co-founder**: Andrew D’Souza (right)

Additional **key members** include;

* VP of finance & co-founder: Ivan Gritsiniak
* VP of Business operations & co-founder: Charlie Feng
* VP of product & co-founder: Tanay Delima

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Romanow and D'Souza are both considered as serial business owners with outstanding know-how and achievement in the digital industry. By founders for founders is their slogan. The Clearco partners, who have experience on both sides of the entrepreneurial divide, saw a key flaw in the current financing options available to startups and emerging businesses. Since founders are passionate about their concepts, they shouldn't be forced to give up a portion of their firm to private equity investors in order to fulfil their objectives. There was high demand on the market for a modern financial framework . In response, Clearco created an equity-free investment strategy, inspired by their own personal experiences.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Due to its excellent reputation and competence, the venture capitalist option offered by the Clearco founders continues to attract growing attention from investors. The most recent equity report, which was released in 2019, states that Clearco raised $300 million CAD over the course of two fundraising rounds. The company's limited partners contributed more than 80% ($250 million CAD) of the purchased equity, according to the publicly available information Clearco provides. The money raised will go toward a series three fund that will assist Clearco's e-commerce partners in successfully expanding their operations. The final $50 million CAD came from prominent investors Highland Capital, iNovia, and Emergence Capital as a series B investment source, making up the remaining portion of the funds acquired at the end of 2018.

## Business Activities

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Clearco's co-founders recognised a key hole in the entrepreneurial finance structure after successfully starting and running a number of enterprises focused toward the digital economy. Startups, developing businesses, and early-stage organisations all require equity finance to further their brand ambitions. Many of these stakeholders must give up some of their ownership or share of personal assets in order to get the cash they require to achieve their objectives. Romanow, a digital entrepreneur who founded five successful startup firms, and D'Souza, who raised millions of dollars and coached other businesses, both fulfilled the dreams of aspiring entrepreneurs. Clearco, a venture capital firm that is not your typical venture capitalist, responded by innovating.

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Clearco was formed with the goal of offering an alternative to the current funding and credit choices for sharing economy businesses. Clearco has seen a surge in the number of freelancers providing in-demand digital services. North America's market is predicted to grow during the next decade. Clearco participates in the freelancing economy by advising and assisting direct-to-consumer e-commerce enterprises. With increased investment from angel investors, venture capitalists, and banks, direct-to-consumer merchants are a rising company. However, in order to acquire the capital needed to expand their online firm and attract their target customer group, many of these e-commerce entrepreneurs drastically sacrifice their ownership. Many of these DTC freelancers, according to Clearco co-founder Romanow, are ignorant of the potential value of their shares over the next few years. If Clearco's ambitions are realised, they will play an important supporting role in the freelancing and sharing economy, allowing entrepreneurs to own a bigger piece of their company.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

In the traditional financial services market, freelancers are seen as high-risk assets, and they typically cannot obtain the necessary funds without paying exorbitant fees and interest rates. When financial investors and private equity companies invest in new enterprises, they want to have a large stake in order to maximise the development plan and return on investment. Because Clearco is an equity partner, digital entrepreneurs are not constrained by the traditional "clunky" (as Romanow puts it) financing techniques.

Clearco provides a non-dilutive revenue share agreement to its e-commerce partners. That is, entrepreneurs do not have to risk their own assets or business stake in order to get the necessary equity. Clearco not only provides modern venture capital solutions, but they also do it through an easily accessible platform. Clearco invented the "20-minute term sheet" to assess credit underwriting judgments, removing physical hurdles and time restrictions traditionally associated with soliciting investors and closing deal time. Investment is based on two positive metrics: ad spending and startup unit economics, combined with a machine learning system capable of reviewing a firm's marketing and revenue data. Clearco can provide immediate finance to the company within 48 hours once the algorithm has examined and processed the data. Unlike the usual venture capital procedure, which requires pitches and months of data collection to determine if the business will be equitable in the long run, the start-to-finish cycle takes about twenty minutes.

Clearco's competitive edge stems not only from their unorthodox access to investor money, but also from the assistance and brand elevation methods they provide to its customers. Michele Romanow and Andrew D'Souza are digital economy professionals who share their business expertise and personal experiences as entrepreneurs. Romanow, for example, has founded numerous of her own e-commerce startup enterprises that have achieved quick development and attracted significant purchasers within a few years. Furthermore, as the youngest angel investor on Canada's Dragons Den, she has heard hundreds of proposals from the sector, offering her a unique perspective on the problems and experiences that contemporary entrepreneurs have with the traditional fundraising process.

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Clearco found a demand in the freelancing market for quick cash without requiring business ownership or personal assets as collateral. Client acquisition tactics consume a sizable portion of entrepreneurs' venture capital funds. According to Clearco research, marketing on Google and Facebook consumes 40% of startup investor resources rather than product development. Recognizing the value of equity, Clearco works with e-commerce entrepreneurs as a co-investor, assisting them in developing their brand and market reach without the requirement for ownership.

Instead, when investing in freelancers, Clearco employs two measures to detect underwriting growth potential and risks using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. Clearco's machine learning data-driven algorithms assess the startup's health and future growth plan by using positive ad metrics and unit economic analyses. Furthermore, Clearco use artificial intelligence to analyse the firm's revenue data, return on ad spend, and marketing data in order to establish viable funding choices that may be supplied to entrepreneurs. The artificial intelligence technology introduced one of the businesses' newest competitive advantages: the "20-minute term sheet." The use of AI technology shortens the credit underwriting process and the months of data collecting that traditional venture capital firms utilise in the investing process.

## Landscape

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Clearco offers venture capital investment alternatives in the Canadian (and US) financial lending industry.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Emerging and expanding fintech firms are driving exponential development in the loan business. In Canada, financial institutions are not required to possess a licence. As a result, the lending environment has been undergoing inventive remodelling during the last decade. Fintech firms, which are not subject to the same rules and regulations as traditional financial institutions, provide specialised services and alternative funding choices to individuals and enterprises.

#### **Market Trends**

* When financial institutions began to react to market demand for digital services, the lending sector underwent significant transformation. Firms innovated traditional banking services by introducing novel access to financial resources via the use of algorithms and other cutting-edge technology. Fintech businesses established platforms and networks to replace the brick-and-mortar banking branches that consumers were accustomed to by upgrading customary operations. Many Canadians abandoned their affiliations with larger banks as fintech startups specialised in lending acquired a name and attracted the required money to expand their services. Fintech lending firms were able to take on high-risk portfolios, provide clients long-term loans, and offer equity services at a reduced rate as the landscape's market sector developed.The expansion of peer-to-peer lending in the fintech industry interfered with banking institutions as they emerged as important rivals. As the digital transformation period progressed, reinventing processes to boost efficiency became a prominent trend in the fintech lending industry. To boost the industry's competitive edge, fintech firms embraced data-driven models backed by machine learning algorithms to decrease both internal and external risks and enhance profitability.

* Improvements in efficiency have continued to be a prominent trend in the fintech lending business in recent years. Artificial intelligence breakthroughs have led to the deployment of AI technologies to expedite customer application, lending programmes, and underwriting procedures. Automation and accessibility are two recent trends propelling the alternative lending business. Recognizing the market desire for innovation in lending and financing procedures, major Canadian banks are working with successful fintech startups to help them provide money to consumers and enterprises. Building alliances with big financial institutions enables fintech startups to offer the money that clients require, while conventional banks may participate in the adoption of automated systems that are speed-oriented and data-driven.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?

A **few major competitors** in the Canadian lending domain include;

* **Shopify** : Provides ecommerce businesses with an integrated platform that allows them to develop a successful business.

* **Easy Financial**: Offers consumer lending through an omnichannel strategy that relies on technology.

* **OnDeck Canada**: Provides small to medium sized businesses with access to online credit loans.

* **Justwealth**: Provides clients, companies, and high-wealth investors access to custom investment portfolios and financing options.

* **Lending Loop**: A peer-to-peer fintech company providing small businesses access to capital.

* **Nest Wealth**: Provides their clients with access to direct-to-investor portfolio options and other financial management products.

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Clearco has succeeded to disrupt the venture capital business since its inception. Their innovative use of AI technology and revenue growth measures has enabled them to create a one-of-a-kind credit underwriting method known as "the 20-minute term sheet." Unlike other venture capital rivals and alternative financing fintech startups, the co-founders' distinct experiences and industry knowledge enabled them to achieve the expanding success they have today. Clearco's aim of allowing more entrepreneurs to control more of their businesses is still being met. Their revenue share approach, backed by artificial intelligence analytics, has enabled them to invest $150 million CAD in over 500 Canadian direct-to-consumer e-commerce enterprises. Furthermore, the "20-minute term sheet" approach has greatly reduced bias that is frequent in the venture capital industry. The bulk of the sponsored enterprises rejected by VC firms were owned by women or visible minorities. Clearco's initiatives continue to have an impact on the modernisation of the loan business and the accompanying social structures.
### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?

Both the lending and alternative lending industries use similar key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and monitor their success. Research suggests there are eight primary metrics financial firms should use to analyze their growth and success model.

1. Pull through rate
2. Decision to close time
3. Abandoned loan rate
4. Average origination value
5. Application approval rate
6. Net charge-off rate
7. Customer acquisition cost
8. Average number of conditions per loan

### How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Despite the fact that Clearco does not reveal valuation financials or performance numbers, recent third-party reports based on the amount of money raised and the number of clients backed indicate that the capital as a service (CaaS) firm is on track. The first aim of Clearco is to give over 200 firms with access to $1 billion CAD in equity-free funding. Clearco looks to be performing admirably based on its current client acquisition and pull through rates. However, given the present economic conditions are affecting many firms, future reporting on Clearco's financials may reveal unexpected results.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Clearco's combination of AI technology and industry experience positions them as the domain leader when compared to their market competitors. The usage of a "20-minute term sheet" in the underwriting review process shows that the firm is ahead of the competition in the fintech alternative financing sector. While other companies use machine learning algorithms to help them make venture capital choices, none can match Clearco's speed and efficiency for its clients. Clearco's activities are focused on automation and efficiency. Unlike venture capitalists, they are forerunners in revolutionising the investing sector due to their emphasis on innovation and access to non-dilutive finance.
